#Facebook connect for chrome extension

There is no JS SDK that works with chrome Extensions. Hence 
this ia an attempt to facilitate making facebook apps with chrome extensions.

It is an sample on how you can connect to facebook and retrieve access token if you are intrested in fetching various types of data from Graph Api. 
 
[Mr.Nobu Funaki](https://github.com/zuzara) originally 
worked on this. It is updated to the latest and greatest.
